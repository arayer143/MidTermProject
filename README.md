# MidTermProject


This is a Mid Term project that I helped create with the help of two classmates in college 

Teamwork between the three of us was needed to complete this project and after three or four zoom meetings, we where able to complete Spuds Burger menu using the C++ language. 



Download the Zip file and extract, go into the Mid Term project folder and open the Mid Term Project.sln in Visual Studio.
